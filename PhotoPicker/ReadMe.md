# PhotoPicker - Using UIImagePickerController to Select Pictures and Take Photos

This sample demonstrates how to choose images from the photo library, take a picture using the device's camera, and how to customize the look of the camera's user interface.
This is done by using `UIImagePickerController`.  The chosen image or camera photo is displayed in a `UIImageView`.
To customize the camera's interface, this sample shows how to use an overlay view.  With this overlay view it gives you the ability to customize the UI as you take a picture.

Among the custom features of the camera is to take a single picture, a timed picture, or repeated pictures like a camera with a fast shutter speed.
Timed and shutter speed camera shots are done using the `NSTimer` class.
